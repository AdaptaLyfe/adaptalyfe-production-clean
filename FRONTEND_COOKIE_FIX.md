# Frontend Cookie and Authentication Fix

## Issue Identified
The browser console shows 401 authentication errors for API calls, indicating that session cookies are not being properly sent from the frontend to the backend after login.

## Root Causes
1. **Cookie SameSite Policy**: Was set to 'none' which can cause issues in some browsers
2. **Session Cookie Configuration**: May not be properly configured for same-origin requests
3. **Frontend Cookie Handling**: Browser may not be storing/sending cookies correctly

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Cookie Configuration Optimization
Updated session cookie settings in server-simple.js:
```javascript
cookie: {
  secure: false,        // HTTP compatible for development
  httpOnly: true,       // Security - prevent XSS access  
  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  sameSite: 'lax'      // Better browser compatibility
}
```

### 2. Complete API Endpoint Coverage
Added all missing endpoints that frontend was requesting:
- `GET /api/subscription` - User subscription details
- `GET /api/login` - Authentication status check  
- `GET /api/dashboard` - Dashboard summary data

### 3. Session Debugging Enhanced
All protected endpoints now log detailed session information to help identify authentication issues.

## Expected Resolution
- Browser should now properly store login session cookies
- Dashboard API calls should authenticate successfully  
- Content loading errors should be resolved
- User can access all premium features after login

## Testing Results
All API endpoints working with proper authentication:
- `/api/subscription`: ✅ Premium tier with all features
- `/api/dashboard`: ✅ Complete dashboard summary  
- `/api/tasks`: ✅ Medical and wellness tasks
- `/api/medications`: ✅ Vitamin schedules
- `/api/user`: ✅ Profile with premium status

The comprehensive medical application should now load complete dashboard content with proper authentication persistence.
