# Vercel Corrected Configuration

## Issue Fixed
Vercel error: "functions property cannot be used in conjunction with builds property"

## Solution
Updated to use modern Vercel configuration:
- Removed conflicting `builds` property
- Used `functions` for serverless backend
- Added proper `rewrites` for API routing
- Created `/api/server.js` as entry point

## Files to Upload:
1. **vercel.json** (corrected configuration)
2. **api/server.js** (Vercel serverless entry point)

## Configuration Details:
- `buildCommand`: npm run build
- `outputDirectory`: dist/public (Vite build output)
- `runtime`: nodejs20.x (proper Node version)
- API routes: `/api/*` â†’ serverless function

## Expected Result:
Vercel should now:
- Build successfully with npm run build
- Generate index-B9yXiVfA.js with smart backend detection
- Deploy frontend to CDN
- Run backend as serverless functions
- Handle routing properly between frontend and API

This resolves the Vercel configuration conflict and provides clean deployment.
