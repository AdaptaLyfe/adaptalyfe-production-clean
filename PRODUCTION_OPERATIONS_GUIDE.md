## Environment Management

### Production Environment Variables (Railway)
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=[PostgreSQL connection string]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[Production Stripe key]
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=[Production Stripe public key]
```

### Development Environment (Replit)
- Keep development secrets separate
- Use demo data for testing
- Regular sync with production features

## Deployment Process

### Code Updates
1. **Development**: Test changes in Replit environment
2. **GitHub**: Push updates to repository
3. **Railway**: Auto-deploys from GitHub main branch
4. **Verification**: Test on Railway URL before announcing
5. **Backup URLs**: Verify Firebase and custom domain still work

### Emergency Rollback
