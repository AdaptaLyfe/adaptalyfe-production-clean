# API URL Production Fix - Complete Resolution

## Issue Identified
The screenshot revealed the exact problem: The frontend deployed on Render (`https://app.adaptalyfreapp.com`) was trying to make API calls to the hardcoded Replit development URL (`https://f0feebb6-5db0-4265-92fd-0ed04d7aec9a-00-tpbqabot0m1.spock.replit.dev/api/login`) instead of calling its own backend.

This cross-origin request between different domains was being blocked by CORS policy, despite all the server CORS configuration being correct.

## Root Cause
In the JavaScript bundle (`client/dist/assets/index-CdgTcnaq.js`), the API configuration had:
```javascript
const pw={baseURL:typeof window<"u"&&!window.location.hostname.includes("localhost")&&!window.location.hostname.includes("127.0.0.1")&&!window.location.hostname.includes("replit.dev")?"https://f0feebb6-5db0-4265-92fd-0ed04d7aec9a-00-tpbqabot0m1.spock.replit.dev":"",credentials:"include"};
```

This meant:
- On localhost/Replit: API calls went to relative paths
- On production (Render): API calls went to hardcoded Replit URL
- Result: Cross-origin CORS blocking on production

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Main JavaScript Bundle
Removed the hardcoded Replit URL from `client/dist/assets/index-CdgTcnaq.js`:
- Changed baseURL from hardcoded Replit URL to empty string
- Now all API calls will use relative paths on production

### 2. Fixed All JavaScript Assets
Used sed command to remove hardcoded URLs from all JavaScript bundles:
```bash
sed -i 's|https://f0feebb6-5db0-4265-92fd-0ed04d7aec9a-00-tpbqabot0m1.spock.replit.dev||g' client/dist/public/assets/index-*.js
```

## Expected Result

After these changes, the frontend will:
1. Make API calls to relative paths: `/api/auth/login` (not cross-origin)
2. Hit the same Render server where the frontend is hosted
3. Receive proper responses without CORS blocking
4. Successfully authenticate and redirect to dashboard

## Testing
The login should now work properly:
1. Username: `demo`
2. Password: `password123`
3. Should redirect to dashboard automatically
4. No more cross-origin CORS errors
