# Routing Order Fix - CORS Headers Applied Correctly

## Problem Analysis
The CORS errors persist because the authentication route may be getting intercepted by static file middleware before CORS headers are applied properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Route Order Correction
Moved the `/api/auth/login` route BEFORE static file middleware:
- Ensures CORS headers are applied to API routes first
- Prevents static file handler from interfering with API requests
- Explicit CORS header setting on the login route itself

### 2. Enhanced Route-Specific Headers
Added explicit CORS headers directly on the login route:
```javascript
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
```

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Debugging
Added raw response object logging to see exactly what the browser receives from the server.

## Expected Behavior

After deployment, the login request should:
1. Hit the authentication route before any static file handling
2. Receive proper CORS headers directly from the route handler
3. Successfully complete without CORS blocking
4. Redirect to dashboard after successful authentication

## Testing Results Expected

Console should show:
```
🔍 Fetch intercepted: /api/auth/login
🔍 Raw response object: Response {status: 200, ok: true, ...}
✅ Fetch response received: {status: 200, ok: true, headers: [...]}
🚀 Login API success detected, triggering redirect
```

Server logs should show:
```
🔐 LOGIN ATTEMPT - Headers: {...}
🔐 LOGIN ATTEMPT - Body: {username: 'demo', password: 'password123'}
✅ LOGIN SUCCESS - User: demo
```

This routing order fix should resolve the persistent CORS blocking issue by ensuring API routes receive proper headers before any other middleware interference.
