# Custom Domain White Page Fix

## Problem Identified:
- app.adaptalyfeapp.com showing blank white page
- Firebase hosting at adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app working correctly
- Custom domain configuration issue

## Diagnosis Steps:
1. Check DNS resolution for app.adaptalyfeapp.com
2. Verify custom domain configuration in Firebase
3. Confirm proper domain pointing and SSL setup

## Potential Causes:
- Custom domain not properly linked to Firebase project
- DNS records pointing to wrong destination
- SSL certificate not provisioned for custom domain
- Firebase hosting configuration mismatch

## Immediate Solutions:

### Option 1: Fix Custom Domain Configuration
1. Go to Firebase Console → Hosting → Add Custom Domain
2. Add app.adaptalyfeapp.com to your Firebase project
3. Configure proper DNS records as instructed by Firebase
4. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning

### Option 2: Update DNS Configuration
- Verify CNAME or A records point to Firebase hosting
- Ensure no conflicting DNS entries
- Check TTL settings for quick propagation

### Option 3: Temporary Workaround
- Use Firebase URL (adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app) which is working
- Update API configuration to use Firebase domain temporarily
- Fix custom domain configuration separately

The Firebase hosting is working perfectly - the issue is specifically with the custom domain configuration, not the application itself.
