# Alternative Download Methods for AdaptaLyfe Project

Since direct download from Replit may have issues, here are alternative approaches:

## Method 1: GitHub Repository Upload
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload your project files to GitHub
3. Download as ZIP from GitHub
4. Share the GitHub repository link

## Method 2: Replit Deployment URL
Your project is running at the Replit URL. You can:
1. Access the files through the browser
2. Use the file manager to download individual files
3. Clone the Replit project to your local machine

## Method 3: Manual File Transfer
1. Use the Replit file browser
2. Download files in smaller chunks
3. Recreate the project structure locally

## Method 4: Cloud Storage Upload (Manual)
If you have access to any cloud storage:
1. Download files from Replit file manager
2. Upload to your preferred cloud storage
3. Share the cloud storage link

## Current Project Status
- File: `adaptalyfe-final-ready-20250730-1101.zip` (132 MB)

- Capacitor configuration complete

## Immediate Action Needed
Since you need the files urgently for app store submission:
1. Try the Replit file manager download
2. If that fails, we can break the project into smaller downloadable chunks
3. Upload individual components to your preferred cloud storage

The project is technically complete and ready for mobile app deployment.
