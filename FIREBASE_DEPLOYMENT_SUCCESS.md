## Current Architecture

```
Firebase Frontend (Static Files)
        â†“ API Calls with Credentials
Replit Backend (Full Server + Database)
        â†“ Database Operations
PostgreSQL (Sleep tracking + All features)
```

## Expected Results

Your Firebase app now provides:
- âœ… Complete app functionality
- âœ… User authentication and login
- âœ… Sleep tracking with blue/green styled buttons
- âœ… Database operations for all features
- âœ… Task management, mood tracking, financial features
- âœ… Cross-origin session management

## How to Test

1. **Visit**: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app
2. **Login** with existing credentials
3. **Navigate** through app features
4. **Test Sleep Tracking** - buttons should work with database
5. **Check Console** - API calls should go to Replit backend

## Architecture Benefits

- **Firebase**: Fast global CDN for frontend
- **Replit**: Full backend with working database
- **No Backend Deployment Needed**: Use existing Replit infrastructure
- **Seamless Integration**: Cross-origin authentication working

Your app is now fully functional on Firebase with all recent improvements! ðŸŽ‰
