# Assets Folder

This folder contains app icons, splash screens, and other visual assets for the Adaptalyfe mobile app.

## Required Assets

To complete the Expo Go setup, you'll need to add these image files:

### App Icon
- `icon.png` - 1024x1024px app icon
- `adaptive-icon.png` - 1024x1024px adaptive icon for Android

### Splash Screen
- `splash.png` - 1284x2778px splash screen image

### Notifications
- `notification-icon.png` - 96x96px notification icon

### Favicon
- `favicon.png` - 32x32px favicon for web

## Creating Assets

You can:
1. Use the existing Adaptalyfe branding from your web app
2. Create simple placeholder images with the Adaptalyfe logo
3. Use Expo's asset generation tools: `npx expo install expo-app-icon-utils`

The app will work with Expo Go even without these assets, but they'll improve the user experience.
