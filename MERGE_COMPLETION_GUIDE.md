# Merge Completion Instructions

## Current Status
All files show green checkmarks in Git panel - conflicts are resolved:
✅ README.md 
✅ package.json
✅ index.html
✅ manifest.json

## INDEX_LOCKED Error Resolution

The lock file is causing the issue. After clearing it:

1. **Dismiss the red error banner** by clicking the X
2. **Look for "Complete merge and commit" button** in the Git panel
3. **Click it** to finalize the merge
4. **All 1021+ commits will push to GitHub**

## If Button Still Not Available
Try these steps in the Git panel:
1. Click "Refresh" or refresh the entire Replit page
2. The panel should recognize all conflicts are resolved
3. "Complete merge and commit" button should appear
4. Click to finish the merge

## Expected Result
- All local commits sync to GitHub
- Repository ready for Vercel deployment
- Professional hosting pipeline operational

The application is running perfectly - just need to complete this final merge step.
