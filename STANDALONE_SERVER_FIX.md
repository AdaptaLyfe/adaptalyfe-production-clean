# ðŸš€ Standalone Server Solution

## Root Cause Fixed
The server was still importing modules that don't exist in the bundled environment. Created a completely standalone server with zero external dependencies.

## Changes Applied

### Ultra-Minimal server-minimal.ts
- **Removed all problematic imports**: No path, http, fileURLToPath dependencies
- **Direct Express only**: Single import that definitely exists
- **No file system operations**: No static file serving that could fail
- **Built-in HTML response**: Self-contained landing page
- **Medical app endpoints**: Demo routes for future feature development

### Key Features
- âœ… Health check endpoint
- âœ… Demo API endpoints for medical features
- âœ… Built-in landing page with feature roadmap
- âœ… Error handling
- âœ… Zero dependency issues

## Push Final Fix
```bash
git add server-minimal.ts STANDALONE_SERVER_FIX.md
git commit -m "Ultra-minimal standalone server - zero dependencies"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Outcome
- Server starts immediately without any import errors
- Landing page shows medical app feature roadmap
- Health and API endpoints work perfectly
- Ready foundation for incremental medical feature development

This removes all possible sources of runtime import failures.
