# Final Logo Cache Fix Complete ✅

## Problem Identified:
Brain icons were still appearing because they existed in multiple page headers beyond just the navigation components.

## Pages Fixed:
- ✅ **Landing page** (main entry point)
- ✅ **Login page** header
- ✅ **Register page** header  
- ✅ **Mobile login page** header
- ✅ **Invite landing page** header
- ✅ **Navigation components** (both simple and main)

## Technical Solution:
1. **Removed all Brain imports** from affected pages
2. **Added logo import** to each page: `import logoUrl from "../assets/adaptalyfe-logo.png"`
3. **Replaced Brain icons** with actual logo using proper Vite asset system
4. **Fresh build and deployment** completed

## Current Status:
Your actual AdaptaLyfe logo now displays throughout the entire application instead of any brain icons. The deployment includes:
- Logo properly bundled with hash versioning
- All page headers showing your actual logo
- Consistent branding across all entry points

## URLs to Test:
- **Firebase**: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app
- **Custom Domain**: https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com

**Important**: Clear browser cache or use incognito mode to see the updated logo without cached brain icons.
