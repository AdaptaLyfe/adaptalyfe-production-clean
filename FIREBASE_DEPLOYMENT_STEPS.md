# Deploy Updated Firebase Frontend

## Ready to Deploy âœ…

Your Firebase frontend has been updated to connect to the Replit backend. Here's how to deploy:

## Step 1: Deploy to Firebase
```bash
cd client
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Step 2: Test the Connection
Visit: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app

Expected results:
- âœ… App loads with all styling
- âœ… Sleep tracking with blue/green button boxes
- âœ… All API calls route to working Replit backend
- âœ… Login and authentication functional
- âœ… Database operations working

## What's Fixed

### API Configuration
- All API calls now route to your Replit backend
- Cross-origin requests properly configured
- Authentication cookies work across domains

### CORS Settings
- Firebase domain added to allowed origins
- Replit backend accepts Firebase requests
- Credentials properly handled

### Architecture
```
Firebase (Static Frontend) â†’ Replit (Backend + Database)
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:
1. Check browser developer console for errors
2. Verify API calls are going to Replit domain
3. Test login functionality first

Your app is now configured to work perfectly! ðŸš€
