# Immediate Custom Domain Solution

## Current Status Analysis:

### ✅ Firebase Hosting Working Perfectly
- **URL**: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app 
- **Status**: Fully functional with optimized caching
- **Content**: Complete AdaptaLyfe application

### ❌ Custom Domain Misconfigured  
- **URL**: https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com
- **Status**: Serving wrong content (white page)
- **Issue**: Not connected to Firebase hosting

## Immediate Fix Required:

### Firebase Console Steps:
1. **Login**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/adaptalyfe-5a1d3
2. **Navigate**: Hosting → Custom domains
3. **Add domain**: app.adaptalyfeapp.com
4. **Configure DNS**: Follow Firebase's exact instructions
5. **Wait**: 24-48 hours for propagation

### Alternative Immediate Solution:

#### Option 1: Use Working Firebase URL
- Direct users to: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app
- This URL works perfectly with all features
- No white page issues

#### Option 2: Update API Configuration
If using custom domain is critical, update your DNS records to point directly to Firebase:
- **CNAME**: app.adaptalyfeapp.com → adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app
- **Or A Records**: As provided by Firebase console

## Why This Happened:
Your custom domain was set up independently from Firebase hosting, so it's serving different content. The domain needs to be explicitly connected through Firebase's custom domain process.

## Quick Verification:
Test both URLs:
- ✅ https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app (works)
- ❌ https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com (white page)

The application itself is perfect - this is purely a domain configuration issue.
