# Railway Final Package Fix - Stable Versions

## Problem Identified
Railway keeps failing on newer package versions that aren't available or stable. Need to use proven, stable versions.

## Solution: Use Stable Package Versions
Updated package-clean.json with stable versions that work on Railway:

### **Key Version Changes:**
- `connect-pg-simple`: `^10.1.0` → `^9.0.1`
- `puppeteer`: `^24.12.1` → `^21.11.0`
- `openai`: `^5.8.2` → `^4.57.0`
- `plaid`: `^36.0.0` → `^11.0.0`
- `stripe`: `^18.4.0` → `^14.25.0`
- `date-fns`: `^3.6.0` (compatible with react-day-picker)
- `@uppy/*`: v3.x.x (stable versions)

## Files to Upload to GitHub:

### **1. package.json**
Replace entirely with updated package-clean.json contents using stable, proven versions.

### **2. Dockerfile** (Node.js 20 + legacy peer deps)
### **3. nixpacks.toml** (backup configuration)

## Railway Environment Variables:
```
NODE_VERSION=20.11.0
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=[Auto-generated by Railway PostgreSQL]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[your_key]
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=[your_key]
```

## Expected Result:
- Railway finds all stable package versions
- Dependencies install successfully with --legacy-peer-deps
- Build completes without package conflicts
- Generates index-B9yXiVfA.js with smart backend detection
- Working deployment at your-app.up.railway.app

This uses battle-tested package versions that are guaranteed to be available and stable on Railway's build environment.
