# Replit Uptime Configuration

## Critical Issue Fixed: Reminder Spam Stopped
- Temporarily disabled task reminder service to prevent continuous spam
- Health endpoints added for uptime monitoring
- System now stable and ready for deployment

## Replit Uptime Setup

### Step 1: Enable Always On
**For Production Stability:**
1. Deploy your app using the Deploy button
2. In deployment settings, enable "Always On"
3. This prevents your API from sleeping
4. Ensures 24/7 availability for `api.adaptalyfeapp.com`

### Step 2: Health Check Endpoints Added
**Available endpoints for monitoring:**

#### Simple Health Check:
```
GET /healthz
Response: {"ok": true, "timestamp": "2025-09-01T20:55:00.000Z"}
```

#### Detailed Health Status:
```
GET /api/health
Response: {
  "ok": true,
  "status": "healthy", 
  "timestamp": "2025-09-01T20:55:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "memory": {...},
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### Step 3: Monitoring Setup
**Use these endpoints to:**
- Monitor API availability
- Track system health
- Set up automated alerts
- Verify deployment status

## Deployment Benefits:

### With Always On:
✅ **No API sleep** - instant responses 24/7
✅ **Professional reliability** - enterprise uptime
✅ **Health monitoring** - system status tracking
✅ **Stable connections** - no cold starts

### Production Architecture:
