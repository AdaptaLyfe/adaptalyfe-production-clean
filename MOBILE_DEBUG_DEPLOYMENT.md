# Mobile White Page Debug - Deployment

## Problem:
Mobile devices showing white page on app.adaptalyfeapp.com while desktop works fine.

## Debugging Steps Applied:

### ✅ **Mobile Debug Script Added**
- Added comprehensive error catching for mobile devices
- Mobile device detection logging
- Real-time error display on mobile screens
- User agent logging for device identification

### ✅ **Enhanced Mobile Support**
- Added mobile-specific optimizations in main.tsx
- URLSearchParams polyfill for older mobile browsers  
- Mobile viewport optimization to prevent zoom
- Mobile-specific error handling and display

### ✅ **Service Worker Disabled**
- Temporarily disabled service worker registration
- Service workers can cause caching issues on mobile
- Prevents potential mobile compatibility problems

## Expected Mobile Debugging:
1. **Error Display**: If JavaScript fails, mobile users will see detailed error message
2. **Console Logging**: Mobile browsers will log device detection and errors
3. **User Agent Info**: Detailed mobile device information captured
4. **Reload Option**: Users can easily reload if errors occur

## Next Steps:
After deployment, test on mobile device to:
- See if white page is resolved
- View any error messages displayed
- Check browser console for debugging info
- Identify specific mobile compatibility issues

The mobile debugging system is now active and will help identify the exact cause of the white page issue.
