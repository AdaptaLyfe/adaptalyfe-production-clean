# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue
Railway is serving HTML pages instead of API responses because the routing configuration isn't working correctly for the built application.

## Solution Steps

1. **Push the new configuration files**:
   - `railway.toml` - Railway service configuration
   - `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration for Nixpacks
   - Updated `server/routes.ts` with health check endpoints

2. **Set Environment Variables in Railway**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   DATABASE_URL=<your-postgresql-connection-string>
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your-stripe-public-key>
   ```

3. **Redeploy on Railway**:
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Railway will automatically redeploy with the new configuration

4. **Test endpoints**:
   - Health check: `GET https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
   - Debug info: `GET https://your-app.railway.app/api/debug`
   - Login: `POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/login`

## Key Configuration Changes

### railway.toml
- Health check path configured
- Proper restart policy
- Production environment variables

### nixpacks.toml  
- Correct build and start commands
- Static asset serving configuration
- Node.js production environment

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health` - Basic health check
- `/api/debug` - Environment debugging information

## Expected Result
After redeployment, API calls should return proper JSON responses instead of HTML pages.
