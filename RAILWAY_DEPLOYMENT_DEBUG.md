# Railway Deployment Debug - Exact Issue Found

## Problem Identified
✅ **Server Configuration**: Correct (serves `dist/public` properly)
✅ **Local Build**: Correct (generates `index-B9yXiVfA.js` with smart detection)
❌ **Railway Cache**: Still serves old `index-D_VnzE2d.js` file

## Root Cause
Railway's build cache is stuck and not picking up the new build output with updated JavaScript file.

## Exact Fix Steps

### Step 1: Railway Settings
In Railway dashboard, ensure these exact settings:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
node dist/index.js
```

**Install Command (if available):**
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Force Cache Invalidation
Add these environment variables:
```
RAILWAY_REBUILD_CACHE=true
NODE_ENV=production
BUILD_CACHE_VERSION=20250901
```

### Step 3: Verify Build Output
Railway build logs should show:
```
✓ built in XX.XXs
../dist/public/index.html
../dist/public/assets/index-B9yXiVfA.js  <- NEW FILE
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
After successful build, check:
```bash
curl https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com | grep assets/index-
```
Should return: `index-B9yXiVfA.js` (not `index-D_VnzE2d.js`)

## Expected Results
- ✅ Railway serves `index-B9yXiVfA.js` 
- ✅ Smart backend detection active
- ✅ app.adaptalyfeapp.com loads properly
- ✅ No more white page

The static file serving configuration is perfect - Railway just needs to rebuild with fresh cache.
