# Railway Custom Domain Fix - Upload Instructions

## What This Fix Does
Resolves the blank white page issue on app.adaptalyfeapp.com by implementing smart backend detection.

## Key Changes Made
1. **client/src/lib/config.ts** - Smart backend detection
2. **server/index.ts** - Enhanced CORS configuration  
3. **Built production files** - Ready for Railway deployment

## Smart Detection Logic
- Firebase domain (adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app): Uses Replit backend
- Railway domain (app.adaptalyfeapp.com): Uses local Railway backend

## Upload Instructions
1. Upload all files from this folder to your GitHub repository
2. Commit with message: "Fix Railway custom domain backend detection"
3. Push to trigger Railway deployment
4. Wait for Railway build to complete

## Expected Results After Deployment
- ✅ app.adaptalyfeapp.com loads frontend properly
- ✅ No more blank white page
- ✅ API calls use Railway backend (same domain)
- ✅ Authentication works correctly
- ✅ Full app functionality restored

## Both Domains Will Work
- Firebase: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app (already working)
- Railway: https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com (will work after this upload)

The fix ensures each domain uses the appropriate backend automatically.
