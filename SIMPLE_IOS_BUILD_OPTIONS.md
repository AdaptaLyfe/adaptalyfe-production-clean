# Simpler iOS Build Alternatives to CodeMagic

## Problem with CodeMagic:
- Complex certificate management
- Confusing error messages  
- Manual configuration required
- Hard to debug issues

## Better Options:

### 1. Expo EAS Build (EASIEST)
**Why it's better:**

- ✅ Works with Capacitor
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ One command builds

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build:configure
eas build --platform ios
```

### 2. Capacitor Live Updates (NO APP STORE NEEDED)
**Perfect for your web app:**
- ✅ Deploy instantly without App Store review
- ✅ Users get updates immediately
- ✅ No certificates needed
- ✅ Perfect for web-based apps like Adaptalyfe

**How it works:**
- Your app downloads updates from your server

### 3. Vercel/Netlify + PWA (SIMPLEST)
**Progressive Web App approach:**
- ✅ No App Store needed
- ✅ Users install from browser

- ✅ Much simpler deployment

**Your app already supports this!**

### 4. Ionic Appflow
**Alternative cloud build:**
