# Render Deployment Guide - Complete Setup

## Why Render Instead of Firebase

Perfect choice! Render is ideal for your current needs:
- **Full-stack deployment** (frontend + backend together)
- **PostgreSQL database** included
- **Environment variables** easy to manage
- **Auto-deploy** from GitHub
- **No mobile complexity** until app store launch

## Deploy to Render

### Step 1: Connect GitHub Repository
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create new "Web Service" from your repository

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Environment**: `Node.js`
- **Node Version**: `18.x` (or latest)

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add these in Render dashboard:

**Required:**
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `DATABASE_URL` = (Auto-generated by Render PostgreSQL)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = (Your Stripe secret key)
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = (Your Stripe public key)

**Optional:**
- `SESSION_SECRET` = (Random secure string)

### Step 4: PostgreSQL Database
1. Create PostgreSQL database in Render
2. Render automatically provides `DATABASE_URL`
3. Run migrations: `npm run db:push`

## What You Get

**Single Deployment URL**: `https://your-app.onrender.com`
- ✅ Frontend and backend together
- ✅ Database included
- ✅ Sleep tracking with styled buttons
- ✅ All features working
- ✅ Auto-deploy on Git push

## Remove Firebase (Optional)

Since you're using Render:
- Keep Firebase project for mobile app later
- Remove `firebase.json` and Firebase CLI from current workflow
- Focus on Render deployment for web app

Your app architecture becomes much simpler with Render handling everything in one place!
