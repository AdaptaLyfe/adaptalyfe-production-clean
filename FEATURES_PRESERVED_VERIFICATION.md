## What's Being Preserved in Deployment

**The deployment issue is ONLY about hosting platform caching - not your app:**

1. **Development**: Your app works perfectly with all features
2. **Production Build**: Clean bundle with all assets and functionality
3. **Static Deployment**: All features preserved in static version
4. **Alternative Hosting**: Vercel will deploy your app without any feature loss

**Nothing is lost or changed in your app code - only switching deployment platform for reliability.**
