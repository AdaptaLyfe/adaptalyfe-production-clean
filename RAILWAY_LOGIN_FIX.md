# Railway Login Issue Fix

## Problem Identified
Your Railway app is returning HTML (404 error page) instead of JSON from the `/api/login` endpoint. This indicates:
1. Frontend is making requests to the wrong URL
2. CORS configuration needs Railway domains
3. API routing might not be properly configured

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration
Added Railway domain patterns to `server/production.ts`:
```javascript
origin: [
  // ... existing domains ...
  /\.railway\.app$/,
  /\.up\.railway\.app$/
]
```

### 2. Enhanced Login Endpoint Logging
Added detailed logging to track request flow in `/api/login`

### 3. Frontend API Configuration
The frontend needs to point to your Railway URL. Check your `apiRequest` configuration.

## Next Steps

### 1. Get Your Railway App URL
In Railway Dashboard, find your exact app URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

### 2. Update Frontend API Base URL
The frontend might be pointing to the wrong base URL. We need to ensure it's pointing to:
- Your Railway app URL for production
- Local development for testing

### 3. Environment Variables Check
Ensure these are set in Railway:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (from Railway PostgreSQL service)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` 
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`

## Test Login
After these fixes, try logging in again with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

The enhanced logging will show exactly what's happening in the Railway deployment logs.
