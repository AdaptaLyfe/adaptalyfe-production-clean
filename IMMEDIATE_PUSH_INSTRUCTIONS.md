# ðŸš¨ Immediate Push Required - Manual Git Commands

## Current Problem
Your Render build is still using the old failing configuration. The minimal server fix needs to be pushed to trigger a fresh deployment.

## Manual Git Commands to Run
```bash
git add server-minimal.ts
git add Dockerfile
git add MINIMAL_SERVER_DEPLOY.md
git add DOCKERFILE_PATH_FIX.md
git add ESBUILD_FIX.md
git add DOCKER_RENDER_FIX.md
git commit -m "Add minimal server for successful deployment"
git push origin main
```

## What These Changes Do
1. **server-minimal.ts**: Clean server with no missing dependencies
2. **Updated Dockerfile**: Builds the minimal server instead of broken index.ts
3. **Documentation**: Explains the fix strategy

## Expected Outcome After Push
- Render will detect the new commit
- Docker build will use `server-minimal.ts` (no missing imports)
- Build completes successfully in 2-3 minutes
- Service goes live with health endpoint working

## Verify After Deployment
- Health check: `https://[your-service].onrender.com/health`
- Should return: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","service":"adaptalyfe-medical-app"}`

## Next Steps After Success
Once the minimal server is deployed and working, we can incrementally add back all the medical app features on the stable foundation.
