# Railway Vite Build Fix - Entry Module Resolution

## Progress Made ‚úÖ
- JSON parsing error FIXED with clean package.json
- npm install SUCCESS  
- Vite build process STARTED

## Current Issue
Vite build error: `Could not resolve entry module "client/index.html"`

This means Vite can't find the client/index.html file in the Docker container.

## Root Cause Analysis
The Vite config points to:
- `root: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "client")`
- Looking for `client/index.html`

In Docker container, the path resolution might be different.

## Solution Applied
1. **Added debugging** to Dockerfile to list file structure
2. **Verify client directory** exists in Docker build

## Expected Fix
Once we see the file structure in Railway logs, we can:
1. Adjust Vite config paths if needed
2. Fix entry point resolution
3. Complete the build successfully
4. Deploy with correct `index-B9yXiVfA.js` file

## Progress Summary
‚úÖ Railway Node.js detection  
‚úÖ npm install success
‚úÖ JSON parsing fixed
üîÑ Vite build path resolution (in progress)
‚è≥ Deploy with smart backend detection

We're very close to success - just need to fix the Vite entry path.
