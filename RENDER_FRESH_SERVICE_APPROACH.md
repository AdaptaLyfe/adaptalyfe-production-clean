# Render Fresh Service Approach

## The Strategy

Since your app was working perfectly on Render yesterday, we'll use a fresh service approach that bypasses all cached configurations:

## Updated Configuration

**New render.yaml:**
- **Service name**: `adaptalyfe-render-fresh` (completely different from cached service)
- **Build command**: Uses your working `dist/production.js` 
- **Start command**: `node adaptalyfe-app.js` (different filename than any cached versions)

## Why This Will Work

1. **New service name**: Render won't associate it with cached configurations
2. **Uses working production.js**: The same file that was working yesterday
3. **Different output filename**: `adaptalyfe-app.js` instead of cached names
4. **Clean npm install**: `npm ci` for fresh dependency resolution

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Push updated render.yaml**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh Render service configuration"
git push origin main
```

2. **Create NEW Render service**:
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Service will automatically use the updated render.yaml

3. **Don't modify existing service** - create a completely new one

## What's Preserved

✅ All your app features (sleep tracking, landing page, dashboard)
✅ Stripe payment system
✅ Database connections
✅ All styling and functionality

## Why Not Modify Existing Service

The existing service has cached:
- Old build commands trying to import 'vite'
- Previous file paths and configurations
- Build environment settings

A fresh service starts with a clean slate and your working production code.

This approach gets you back to yesterday's working state on Render.
