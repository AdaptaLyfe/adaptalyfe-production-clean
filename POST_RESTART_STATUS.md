# Git Status After Workflow Restart

## âœ… Workflow Restart Successful
- Application running on port 5000
- All services initialized properly
- Git index lock should be cleared

## Next Steps
1. **Check Git panel again** - the INDEX_LOCKED error should be gone
2. **Look for "Complete merge and commit" button** in the Git interface
3. **Click it** to finalize the merge and push all commits to GitHub

## If Issues Persist
The Replit documentation suggests that persistent Git issues can be resolved by using checkpoints to roll back to a clean state, then reapplying changes. This would provide a fresh Git state for the sync process.

## Current Project Status
- All merge conflicts resolved in files
- Package.json clean with valid syntax
- README.md properly formatted
- Application fully functional
- Ready for GitHub sync and Vercel deployment
