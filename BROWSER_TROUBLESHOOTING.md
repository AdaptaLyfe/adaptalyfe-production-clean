# Browser Troubleshooting for Landing Page

## Current Status
✅ Server authentication is working correctly  
✅ `/api/user` returns 401 "Authentication required"  
✅ Auto-login is completely disabled  
✅ Landing page route is configured properly  

## If you're still seeing the demo dashboard, try these steps:

### Step 1: Force Browser Cache Clear
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. Or go to Application tab → Storage → "Clear site data"

### Step 2: Check Browser Storage
1. Press F12 → Application tab
2. Clear all data under:
   - Local Storage
   - Session Storage  
   - Cookies
3. Refresh the page

### Step 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open new incognito/private window
2. Navigate to your Replit URL
3. You should see the landing page

### Step 4: Check URL
Make sure you're going to the root URL (no /dashboard or /demo in the path)

## What You Should See:
- **Professional landing page** with teal/cyan gradient background
- **"Empowering Independence Through Technology"** headline
- **Header with "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons**
- **Feature cards** showcasing app capabilities
- **No navigation menu** (only shows when authenticated)

## Current Authentication Flow:
- New visitors → Landing page
- Click "Get Started" → Register page  
- Click "Sign In" → Login page
- Click "Try Demo" → Demo dashboard (alex user)
- After login → Real user dashboard
