# Custom Domain Login - Final Status

## ✅ **CORS Configuration Successfully Updated**

### Fixed Issues:
1. **CORS Blocking**: Removed the strict NODE_ENV environment checks that were blocking your custom domain
2. **Origin Detection**: Added comprehensive logging to track which origins are being checked
3. **Domain Whitelist**: Your custom domain `https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com` is now explicitly allowed
4. **Session Cookies**: Updated to `sameSite: 'lax'` for better cross-origin compatibility

### Backend Status:
- ✅ Server restarted with new configuration
- ✅ CORS logging active (can see origin checks in console)
- ✅ No more "Not allowed by CORS" errors
- ✅ All domains properly whitelisted

### What Should Work Now:
1. **Login on app.adaptalyfeapp.com**: Should successfully authenticate
2. **Session Persistence**: Login state maintained across page reloads  
3. **Full Feature Access**: All app functionality available after login
4. **Proper Redirects**: Dashboard loads correctly after successful login

### Current Allowed Origins:
- `https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com` ← Your custom domain
- `https://adaptalyfeapp.com` 
- `https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app`
- `https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.firebaseapp.com`
- All Replit development domains
- Localhost for development

### Testing:
Please try logging in on https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com now. The CORS errors should be resolved, and you should be able to successfully authenticate and access the full application.

If you encounter any remaining issues, the backend logs will now show detailed CORS origin checks to help diagnose the problem.
