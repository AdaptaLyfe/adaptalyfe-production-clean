# Mobile App Deep Linking for Caregiver Invitations

## The White Page Issue is Solved by Mobile Apps ✅

When caregivers have the **actual Adaptalyfe mobile app installed**, they won't experience the white page browser issue because:

### How It Works:
1. **Browser Links** (previous approach): `https://yourapp.com/login?code=ABC123`
   - Opens in phone's browser
   - May have JavaScript loading issues
   - Can show white pages on some mobile browsers

2. **Mobile App Links** (current solution): `adaptalyfe://login?code=ABC123`
   - Opens directly in the Adaptalyfe mobile app
   - No browser involved
   - Instant, reliable experience

### Implementation Details:
- **Android**: Deep link intent filters configured in `mobile-build-project/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- **iOS**: URL scheme handlers configured in Info.plist (to be added)
- **Capacitor Config**: Deep link setup in `capacitor.config.ts`
- **Login Page**: Automatic invitation code detection from URL parameters

### User Experience Flow:
When a caregiver receives an invitation via SMS or email:
1. **With Mobile App Installed**: `adaptalyfe://login?code=ABC123` → Opens directly in app
2. **Without Mobile App**: `https://yourapp.com/login?code=ABC123` → Opens in browser with fallback

### Current Message Format:
```
Hi [caregiver name]! I'd like you to join my Adaptalyfe support network.

If you have the Adaptalyfe app installed:
adaptalyfe://login?code=ABC123

Otherwise, use this web link:
https://yourapp.com/login?code=ABC123

Invitation code: ABC123
```

### Technical Configuration:
- **Deep link scheme**: `adaptalyfe://`
- **Web fallback domain**: User's current domain
- **Android manifest**: Intent filters for both `adaptalyfe://` and `https://adaptalyfe.app`
- **Auto-verification**: Android app links with `android:autoVerify="true"`

### Production Benefits:
- **Zero browser issues** for mobile app users
- **Instant app opening** with pre-filled invitation codes
- **Seamless caregiver onboarding** experience
- **Universal compatibility** with SMS, email, and direct sharing
