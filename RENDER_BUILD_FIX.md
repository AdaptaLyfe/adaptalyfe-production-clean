# Render Build Error Fixed ✅

## Issue Identified
The Render build error was caused by import path resolution for the `config.ts` file during the build process.

## Solution Applied
**Inlined API Configuration**: Moved the API configuration directly into `queryClient.ts` to eliminate the import dependency that was causing build failures.

## Changes Made
- ✅ **Removed external config import** from `queryClient.ts`
- ✅ **Inlined API_CONFIG** with same environment detection logic
- ✅ **Preserved all functionality** including Replit/Render environment routing
- ✅ **Maintained all features** - no functionality lost

## Build Status
- ✅ **Local build succeeds** - `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ **All features preserved** - sleep tracking, payments, dashboard, etc.
- ✅ **No design changes** - cyan-teal-blue gradient maintained
- ✅ **Ready for Render deployment**

## Deployment Instructions
1. Commit these changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Fix Render build errors - inline config"`
2. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`  
3. Render will automatically redeploy with working build

Your app will maintain all features while fixing the build errors that were preventing successful Render deployment.
