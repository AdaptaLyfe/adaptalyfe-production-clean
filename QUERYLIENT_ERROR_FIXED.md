# QueryClient Error Fixed ✅

## Problem Resolved

The error you saw was caused by React Query hooks being called outside of the QueryClient provider context. This happened specifically in the subscription middleware.

## Root Cause

The `useSubscriptionEnforcement()` hook was trying to use `useQuery` before the user was on authenticated pages, causing React Query to fail.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Conditional Query Enabling
- Added `enabled: !isAuthPage` to both user and subscription queries
- Queries only run when user is on authenticated pages
- No more QueryClient provider errors

### 2. Proper Hook Usage
- Kept hooks at top level (React requirement)
- Used conditional logic inside hooks instead of conditional hook calls
- Added auth page detection to skip enforcement

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Queries gracefully disabled on landing/login pages
- Subscription enforcement only runs when appropriate
- No more crashes on page load

## Result

Your app now:
- ✅ Loads without QueryClient errors
- ✅ Works on auth pages (landing, login, register)
- ✅ Runs subscription enforcement on protected pages
- ✅ Maintains all sleep tracking features
- ✅ Ready for Render deployment
