## Configuration Files

### Capacitor Config (`capacitor.config.ts`)
```typescript
{
  appId: 'com.adaptalyfe.app',
  appName: 'Adaptalyfe',
  webDir: 'public',
  server: {
    url: 'https://f0feebb6-5db0-4265-92fd-0ed04d7aec9a-00-tpbqabot0m1.spock.replit.dev',
    cleartext: true
  },
  plugins: {
    SplashScreen: {
      launchShowDuration: 2000,
      backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
      showSpinner: true,
      spinnerColor: "#6366f1"
    }
  }
}
```

### Mobile Initialization (`client/src/lib/mobile.ts`)
- Platform detection functions
- Status bar styling
- Keyboard configuration
- Safe initialization check

---

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Edit Web App**
   ```bash
   # Make your changes in client/src
   npm run dev  # Test in browser
   ```

2. **Build for Mobile**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   ```

3. **Test on Mobile**
   ```bash
   # iOS
   npx cap open ios
   # Run in Xcode
   
   # Android
   npx cap open android
   # Run in Android Studio
   ```

### Updating App

1. **After Code Changes**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   ```

2. **After Plugin Changes**
   ```bash
   npm install @capacitor/plugin-name
   npx cap sync
   ```

3. **Clean Rebuild (if issues)**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync
   # iOS: Xcode → Product → Clean Build Folder
   # Android: ./gradlew clean
   ```

---

## Important Notes

### URLs and Backend
- **Web App**: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app (Firebase)
- **Mobile Backend**: https://...spock.replit.dev (same as web)
- **Local Development**: http://localhost:5000

### Permissions
- iOS: Permissions requested at runtime (when feature is used)
- Android: Permissions declared in manifest, requested at runtime
- Always provide clear explanations why permissions are needed

### Code Reuse
- **95% Code Reuse**: Same React codebase for web and mobile
- **Conditional Features**: Use `isMobilePlatform()` for mobile-only code
- **No Separate Codebase**: Single React app, multiple deployment targets

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"npx cap sync" fails:**
```bash
# Ensure web app is built first
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

**iOS build errors:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd ios/App
pod install
# Then rebuild in Xcode
```

**Android build errors:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

**Status bar not changing:**
- Ensure mobile.ts is imported in main.tsx
- Check that isMobilePlatform() returns true on device
- Verify @capacitor/status-bar is installed
