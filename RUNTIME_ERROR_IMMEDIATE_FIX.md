# Runtime Error Immediate Fix

## Problem:
User still experiencing runtime errors after previous fixes.

## Root Cause:
Likely the `AuthUtils` import or `useRef` hook causing issues in production build.

## Immediate Solutions Applied:
1. **Commented out AuthUtils import** - Removing potential source of runtime error
2. **Simplified navigation logic** - No complex authentication checks
3. **Clean rebuild and deploy** - Fresh deployment without problematic imports

## Alternative Fixes if Issue Persists:
1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Clear all browser cache** completely
3. **Try incognito/private browsing mode**
4. **Disable browser extensions** that might interfere

## Expected Result:
The application should now load without runtime error overlays, showing your logo and working navigation.

If still seeing errors, please share the exact error message from browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab).
