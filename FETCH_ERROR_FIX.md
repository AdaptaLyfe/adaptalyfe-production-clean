# ðŸš¨ "Failed to Fetch" Error - DIAGNOSIS & FIX

## Problem Identified
"Failed to fetch" error when trying to log in indicates the frontend cannot connect to the backend authentication endpoints.

## Root Causes & Solutions

### Issue 1: Server Not Running with Authentication
**Problem**: Render may still be using old server without authentication endpoints
**Solution**: Ensure `server-simple.js` with authentication is deployed

### Issue 2: Frontend/Backend API Mismatch
**Problem**: Frontend expects `/api/auth/login` but server may be on different route
**Solution**: Verify authentication endpoints are accessible

### Issue 3: CORS Configuration
**Problem**: Cross-origin requests blocked between frontend and backend
**Solution**: CORS is configured in server-simple.js but may need adjustment

## Testing & Verification

### Backend Authentication Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-render-url.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"demo","password":"password123"}'
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "demo",
    "email": "demo@adaptalyfe.com",
    "role": "patient",
    "subscriptionTier": "premium"
  }
}
```

## Immediate Fixes Applied

### 1. Request Logging Added
- Server now logs all incoming requests
- Helps identify if requests are reaching the backend

### 2. Static File Serving Improved
- Multiple static file paths configured
- Better compatibility with production deployment

### 3. Path Resolution Fixed
- Dynamic path resolution for production vs development
- Prevents file not found errors

## Next Steps
1. Push updated server-simple.js to GitHub
2. Render will auto-deploy with authentication
3. Test login with demo credentials
4. Verify all medical app features work

## Demo Credentials
- Username: `demo`
- Password: `password123`

The authentication system is complete - just needs deployment to resolve the fetch error.
