# Railway Settings Fix - Step by Step

## Current Location: Railway Project Settings âœ…

You're in the right place! Now let's check and fix the specific settings causing the deployment issue.

## Step 1: Click "production" Environment
I can see you have a "production" environment that was "Updated 2 hours ago". Click on it to access the environment settings.

## Step 2: Check Build & Start Commands
Once in the production environment, look for:

### Build Command Should Be:
```
npm run build
```

### Start Command Should Be:
```
node dist/index.js
```

### Root Directory Should Be:
```
/
```
(or leave blank)

## Step 3: Add Cache-Busting Environment Variables
In the environment variables section, add these:

```
RAILWAY_REBUILD_CACHE=true
NODE_ENV=production
FORCE_FRESH_BUILD=true
```

## Step 4: Check GitHub Integration
Look for "Integrations" or "Source" settings to verify:
- Repository: AdaptaLyfe/adaptalyfe-production-clean
- Branch: main
- Auto-deploy: Enabled

## Step 5: Force Redeploy
After making these changes:
1. Save all settings
2. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for complete rebuild

## Expected Result
After these changes, Railway should:
- Pull latest GitHub code with smart backend detection
- Generate new JavaScript file (index-B9yXiVfA.js)
- Fix the white page on app.adaptalyfeapp.com

The key is ensuring Railway uses the correct build commands and clears its cache to pick up your GitHub changes.
