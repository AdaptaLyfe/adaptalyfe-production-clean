# Railway Nuclear Option - Back to What Worked

## Key Insight
You said: "I was able to deploy earlier without issue - except only a white page loading"

This means:
- ✅ Railway build process WORKED before
- ✅ Files were deployed successfully 
- ❌ Only issue was white page (old JavaScript files)

## Problem Analysis
I've been overcomplicating this. Railway was building successfully before, the only issue was serving old cached JavaScript files instead of the new ones with smart backend detection.

## Nuclear Solution: Revert to Nixpacks
1. **Delete Dockerfile** (was causing build issues)
2. **Use nixpacks.toml** (Railway's preferred method)
3. **Simple configuration** - let Railway handle it

## Files to Upload:
- **nixpacks.toml** (simple config)
- **Delete Dockerfile** (remove from GitHub)

## Expected Result:
Railway should:
1. Build successfully (like before)
2. Generate the correct `index-B9yXiVfA.js` file  
3. Deploy without white page issue

The focus should be on getting Railway to generate the NEW JavaScript file with smart backend detection, not fighting the build process.
