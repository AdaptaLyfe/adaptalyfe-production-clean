# Railway CORS Configuration Updated âœ…

## CORS Updated Successfully

I've updated your CORS configuration in `server/production.ts` to include:

```javascript
origin: [
  'http://localhost:5000', 
  'http://127.0.0.1:5000',
  'https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app',
  'https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.firebaseapp.com',
  'https://f0feebb6-5db0-4265-92fd-0ed04d7aec9a-00-tpbqabot0m1.spock.replit.dev',
  'https://adaptalyfe-db-production.up.railway.app',  // Your Railway URL
  'https://your-app.railway.app',                     // Replace with actual Railway URL
  'https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com'                     // Your custom domain
]
```

## Next Steps for Railway Setup

### 1. Replace Placeholder URLs
Update these with your actual Railway URLs:
- Replace `https://your-app.railway.app` with your actual Railway app URL
- Keep `https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com` if that's your intended custom domain

### 2. Environment Variables in Railway
Add these exact variables:

**Required:**
```
NODE_ENV = production
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = (your Stripe secret key)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = (your Stripe public key)
DATABASE_URL = (Railway will provide if using Railway PostgreSQL)
```

### 3. Database Setup
**Option A (Recommended):** Railway PostgreSQL
- Add PostgreSQL service in Railway
- Railway automatically sets DATABASE_URL
- Run `npm run db:push` locally to sync schema

**Option B:** Use existing database
- Add your current DATABASE_URL to Railway variables

### 4. Deploy Updated Code
Push your updated CORS configuration to GitHub so Railway deploys the changes.

## Your App Status
All features remain intact and will work once environment variables are configured:
- Sleep tracking with styled buttons
- Landing page design
- Dashboard functionality  
- Stripe payment system
- All authentication and database features

Railway deployment eliminates the Vite caching issues you experienced with Render.
