Yep—“deep caching” pain on Render is usually a combo of (a) Render’s build/image cache, (b) CDN/browser cache for static files, and (c) a rogue service worker. Here’s a tight, do-this-now checklist that reliably flushes all three layers and keeps it from coming back.

Fix it right now

Clear Render’s build cache and redeploy

In your service → Deploys → ⋯ → Clear build cache & deploy (for Docker services too).

If you use a Dockerfile, add a throwaway ARG to bust layer cache:

ARG CACHE_BUSTER=2025-09-03


(Change the value when you need a fresh build.)

Purge client/CDN cache by changing asset URLs

Make sure your build generates hashed filenames (Vite/CRA/Next do this by default).

If you have any non-hashed assets (e.g., /styles.css, /app.js), add a version query:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css?v=2025-09-03">
<script src="/app.js?v=2025-09-03"></script>


(Any change to v= forces a fresh fetch.)

Set sane Cache-Control headers

HTML should not be cached; static assets can be long-cached if hashed.

Express/Node example (backend on Render):

import express from "express";
import path from "path";

const app = express();

// Long cache for hashed assets
app.use("/assets", express.static("dist/assets", {
  maxAge: "365d",
  immutable: true,
}));

// No cache for HTML shells
app.get(["/", "/index.html", "/*"], (req, res, next) => {
  res.set("Cache-Control", "no-store"); // or "no-cache"
  next();
}, express.static("dist", { index: "index.html" }));

// APIs should never be cached
app.use("/api", (req, res, next) => {
  res.set("Cache-Control", "no-store");
  next();
});


Kill any Service Worker (common “deep cache” culprit)

In Chrome: DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister.

Also delete site data: Application → Clear storage → Clear site data.

If you used PWA tooling, increment the SW version or temporarily disable registration:

// comment this during debugging
// navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js');


Force-refresh locally

On Chromebook/Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+R (hard reload), or open DevTools → right-click refresh icon → Empty cache and hard reload.

CDN edge gotchas (if using a Static Site on Render)

Ensure your index.html (and any HTML) returns Cache-Control: no-store or no-cache.

Only the fingerprinted /assets/* get max-age=31536000, immutable.

If you can’t configure headers on the platform layer, serve HTML through your app (as above) so you control headers.
