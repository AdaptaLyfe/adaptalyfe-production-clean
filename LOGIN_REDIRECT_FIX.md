# Custom Domain Login Fix

## Problem Identified:
- Users can login successfully on custom domain app.adaptalyfeapp.com
- Backend shows successful authentication in logs
- Frontend stuck on login page (not redirecting after successful login)
- Issue: Cross-origin cookie/session problems

## Root Cause:
Cross-origin requests between:
- **Frontend**: app.adaptalyfeapp.com (custom domain)
- **Backend**: replit.dev (development URL)

Cookies may not be properly shared across different domains due to browser security policies.

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration
- Added comprehensive origin detection
- Included all domain variations 
- Improved preflight handling
- Enhanced cookie sharing support

### 2. Session Cookie Configuration
- Need to verify SameSite and Secure settings
- Ensure cookies work across domains
- Check httpOnly and path settings

### 3. Expected Fix:
After backend restart, login should work properly on app.adaptalyfeapp.com with proper session persistence and redirect functionality.

## Testing Steps:
1. Try login on app.adaptalyfeapp.com
2. Verify successful redirect to dashboard
3. Confirm session persistence across page reloads
4. Test all features work properly after login
