# Railway Simple Fix - Without .nvmrc

## Issue
The .nvmrc file isn't downloading properly. Let's use a simpler approach.

## Files to Upload to GitHub:

### **1. nixpacks.toml** (Node version enforcement)
```toml
[variables]
NODE_VERSION = "20.11.0"

[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs_20"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["npm install --legacy-peer-deps"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["npm run build"]

[start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

### **2. Dockerfile** (Backup method)
```dockerfile
FROM node:20.11.0

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --legacy-peer-deps

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Railway Environment Variables:
```
NODE_VERSION=20.11.0
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=[Auto-generated by Railway PostgreSQL]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[your_key]
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=[your_key]
```

## Upload Steps:
1. **nixpacks.toml** - Railway will try this first
2. **Dockerfile** - Railway will use this if nixpacks fails
3. Skip .nvmrc (not needed with these two methods)

## Expected Result:
Railway should use either nixpacks or Dockerfile to force Node.js 20, complete the build, and deploy successfully at your-app.up.railway.app.

This dual approach should work without needing the .nvmrc file.
