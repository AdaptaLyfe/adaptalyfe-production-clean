# Rollback Distance Guidance

## Minimal Rollback Required

You only need to rollback to **before the Git pull/merge attempt** that created the index lock. This happened recently when we tried to sync with GitHub.

## What to Look For in Checkpoints:

1. **Look for a checkpoint from BEFORE the merge conflicts started**
2. **Avoid checkpoints with "merge" or "conflict" in the description**
3. **Choose one where the application was working normally**

## Ideal Checkpoint Characteristics:
- ✅ Application was running successfully
- ✅ No Git merge in progress
- ✅ All your recent work preserved
- ✅ Clean Git status

## What Will Be Preserved:
- All your code changes and improvements
- Database data and user accounts
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Package.json fixes and README updates
- Application functionality

## What Will Be Reset:
- Git merge state (the lock will be cleared)
- Conflict markers and merge process
- Ability to sync cleanly with GitHub

## Recommendation:
**Look for the most recent checkpoint that shows your application working normally WITHOUT any Git merge conflicts or sync attempts in progress.**

This should be within the last few hours, as the Git lock issue is recent and your application has been working well.
