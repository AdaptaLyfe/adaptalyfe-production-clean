# Railway Force Deploy - Alternative Install Method

## Problem Identified
Railway consistently fails on `npm ci` with "code EUSAGE" error. This suggests Railway's environment has compatibility issues with npm ci command.

## Nuclear Solution
Force Railway to use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`:

### Files Created:
1. **railway.json** - Railway-specific deployment config
2. **nixpacks.toml** - Force npm install with compatibility flags

### Key Changes:
- Use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`
- Add `--no-package-lock` flag to bypass lock file issues
- Add `--legacy-peer-deps` for dependency compatibility
- Explicit nixpkgs setup for Node.js 18

### Expected Result:
Railway should:
1. ✅ Install dependencies with `npm install` (bypass ci issues)
2. ✅ Build successfully with `npm run build`
3. ✅ Generate `index-B9yXiVfA.js` with smart backend detection  
4. ✅ Start with `npm start`
5. ✅ Deploy on app.adaptalyfeapp.com

### Alternative Deployment Platforms:
If Railway continues failing:
- **Vercel**: `vercel --prod` (excellent for full-stack)
- **Render**: Similar to Railway, often more stable
- **Fly.io**: Reliable alternative with Docker support

The app works perfectly locally - it's purely a Railway deployment environment issue.
