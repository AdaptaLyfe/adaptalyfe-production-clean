# Render Cache Clear Instructions

## Your App Status: PERFECT âœ…
Development is working flawlessly with all features intact. The Render error is purely a caching issue.

## The Problem
Render is still running the old `index.js` file (which imports Vite) instead of the new `production.js` file (which doesn't import Vite). This is because Render cached the old build configuration.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Push Latest Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Use production server without Vite - force Render refresh"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Clear Render Cache
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your "adaptalyfe" service
3. Click the "Manual Deploy" button
4. Check the box for "Clear build cache"
5. Click "Deploy latest commit"

### Step 3: Alternative (if cache clearing doesn't work)
If the above doesn't work:
1. Delete the current service in Render
2. Create a new service from your GitHub repository
3. It will automatically use the updated `render.yaml` configuration

## What Will Happen
Once Render uses the new configuration, it will:
- Run the correct build command with `production.js`
- Use the clean server bundle without Vite dependencies
- Deploy successfully without any module errors

## Your render.yaml is Correct
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && npm run build && esbuild server/production.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/production.js
startCommand: node dist/production.js
```

This is the correct configuration that will work perfectly once Render stops using the cached old version.
