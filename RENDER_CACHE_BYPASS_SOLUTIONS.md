# Render Cache Bypass Solutions

Since you prefer to stick with Render and it was working yesterday, here are targeted solutions to bypass the caching issue:

## Solution 1: Force Fresh Service (Recommended)

Use `render-force-fresh.yaml` which:
- **New service name**: `adaptalyfe-fresh-deployment` (completely different name)
- **Cache clearing**: Explicitly clears npm cache and removes node_modules
- **Fresh database**: Uses `adaptalyfe-fresh-db` to avoid any database caching
- **Different file names**: Uses `app-server.js` instead of any previously cached names

**Steps:**
1. Rename `render-force-fresh.yaml` to `render.yaml`
2. Push to GitHub
3. Create new Render service (don't use existing one)

## Solution 2: Minimal Build Approach

Use `render-minimal.yaml` which:
- **Simple build command**: Uses basic npm ci and vite build
- **Fallback logic**: If production.js exists, use it; otherwise build fresh
- **Different output**: Uses `main.js` instead of cached file names

## Solution 3: Repository Reset Method

If caching persists:
1. Create a new GitHub repository 
2. Copy your code to the new repo
3. Connect Render to the new repository
4. This completely bypasses any cached repository associations

## Why This Will Work

Yesterday your app was working because:
- Render hadn't cached the problematic build commands yet
- The Vite dependencies were properly handled

Today's issue:
- Render is using cached build configuration from when there were issues
- Cache clearing isn't working because the service is locked to old commands

**The fresh service approach gives you a completely clean slate while keeping all your features intact.**

## Your App Status
✅ Development working perfectly
✅ All features preserved (sleep tracking, landing page, dashboard, payments)
✅ Production server builds successfully
✅ Only deployment platform caching causing issues

This approach should get you back to yesterday's working state on Render.
