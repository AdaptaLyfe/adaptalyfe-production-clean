# CORS Security Improvements

## Security Issue Fixed:
**Problem**: CORS configuration was too permissive, allowing:
- All Vercel domains (wildcards)
- Any replit.dev subdomain
- Potential security vulnerabilities

**Solution**: Implemented strict production CORS policy

## New Secure Configuration:

### Development Environment:
- `http://localhost:5000` - Local development
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000` - Local development alternative
- `*.replit.dev` - Replit development domains only

### Production Environment:
- `https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com` - Your main production domain
- `https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app` - Firebase production domain

## Security Benefits:

### Eliminated Risks:
- ❌ No more wildcard domain access
- ❌ No unauthorized Vercel deployments can access your API
- ❌ No random subdomains can make requests
- ❌ Reduced attack surface significantly

### Enhanced Protection:
- ✅ Only your specific production domains allowed
- ✅ Environment-based security (dev vs production)
- ✅ Credentials properly protected with strict origins
- ✅ Professional security posture

### Production Readiness:
- API at `api.adaptalyfeapp.com` will only accept requests from:
  - Your main app at `app.adaptalyfeapp.com`
  - Your Firebase deployment at `adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app`
- Complete protection against unauthorized API access
- Enterprise-grade security configuration

This ensures your API backend is completely secure and only accessible by your legitimate frontend applications.
