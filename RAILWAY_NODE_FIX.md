# Railway Node Version Fix

## Progress Made ✅
Railway is now:
- ✅ Getting past initialization
- ✅ Running build commands
- ✅ Processing dependencies
- ❌ Node version mismatch causing EBADENGINE warnings

## Root Cause Found
Railway logs show:
- `required: { node: '20 || >=22' }`
- `current: { node: 'v18.20.5', npm: '10.8.2' }`

The app requires Node 20+ but Railway is using Node 18.

## Solution Applied
Updated nixpacks.toml:
- **Changed to nodejs-20_x** (from 18_x)
- **Removed railway.json** (unnecessary complexity)
- **Kept npm install** with legacy-peer-deps for compatibility

## Files to Upload:
- **nixpacks.toml** (updated Node 20)
- **Remove railway.json** (delete from GitHub)

## Expected Result:
With Node 20, Railway should:
1. ✅ Meet Node version requirements
2. ✅ Install dependencies successfully
3. ✅ Build without EBADENGINE warnings
4. ✅ Generate `index-B9yXiVfA.js` with smart backend detection
5. ✅ Deploy successfully on app.adaptalyfeapp.com

This addresses the specific Node version incompatibility shown in the logs.
