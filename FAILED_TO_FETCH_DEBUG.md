# Failed to Fetch Debug - Comprehensive Solution

## Issue Analysis
"Failed to fetch" error indicates the API calls are not reaching the server successfully. This could be due to:

1. **Deployment lag**: Render hasn't picked up the JavaScript bundle changes yet
2. **Browser cache**: Old JavaScript bundles with hardcoded URLs still cached
3. **Network connectivity**: API endpoints not accessible from production
4. **Server configuration**: Backend not properly configured for production requests

## Solution Applied

### 1. API Testing Button Added
Added a "TEST API" button (green, below the blue "NATIVE LOGIN" button) that will:
- Test the `/health` endpoint to verify server connectivity
- Test the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with proper credentials
- Show detailed console output for debugging
- Automatically redirect on successful login

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
The test button will provide detailed console output:
```
Testing API endpoints...
Health endpoint status: 200
Health endpoint response: {status: "healthy", ...}
Login endpoint status: 200
Login endpoint response: {success: true, redirect: '/dashboard'}
Login successful, redirecting...
```

### 3. Cache-Busting Strategy
If the issue persists, try these steps:
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache**: Development tools > Storage > Clear all
3. **Incognito/private browsing**: Test in private window

## Testing Instructions

### Immediate Testing:
1. Look for the **green "TEST API" button** below the blue button
2. Click it to run comprehensive API tests
3. Check browser console for detailed results
4. If health check passes but login fails, there's a server issue
5. If both fail, there's a network/deployment issue

### Expected Results:

#### Success Case:
```
Testing API endpoints...
Health endpoint status: 200
Health endpoint response: {status: "healthy", version: "1.0.0"}
Login endpoint status: 200
Login endpoint response: {success: true, redirect: "/dashboard", user: {...}}
Login successful, redirecting...
```
Then automatic redirect to dashboard.

#### Network Issue Case:
```
Testing API endpoints...
Health endpoint failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch
Login endpoint failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```
This indicates Render deployment or network connectivity issues.

#### Server Issue Case:
```
Testing API endpoints...
Health endpoint status: 200
Login endpoint status: 500
Login endpoint response: {error: "Internal server error"}
```
This indicates backend server issues.

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If API tests pass:
- Login should work with dashboard redirect
- Medical app fully functional

### If API tests fail:
- Check Render deployment status
- Verify server logs on Render dashboard
- Consider deployment restart if needed

The comprehensive medical application with all features will be accessible once the API connectivity is confirmed working.
