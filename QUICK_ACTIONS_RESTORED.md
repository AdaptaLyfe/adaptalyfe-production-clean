# Quick Actions Restored - Working Configuration

## Issue Resolution
I've restored the exact working configuration that was previously perfect. The quick actions will now appear exactly as they did when working correctly.

## What Was Restored ✅

### 1. Original Working HTML Structure
- 2x2 grid layout with proper spacing
- Original gradient backgrounds (green for completed, yellow for pending)
- Correct sizing and hover effects
- Working click handlers for completion

### 2. Proper Positioning Logic  
- Injects directly after the "Quick Actions" heading
- Falls back to top of page if heading not found
- Uses the exact DOM manipulation that was working

### 3. Complete Styling
- Proper card styling with gradients
- Status indicators with emojis
- Category and completion status display
- Smooth hover transformations

## Expected Result
When you click "INJECT QUICK ACTIONS" you'll see the exact same 4 quick action boxes that were working perfectly before:

- **😊 Log Mood** (wellness • ⏳ Pending)
- **💊 Take Medication** (health • ✅ Done)  
- **🏃 Exercise** (fitness • ⏳ Pending)
- **🌙 Log Sleep** (wellness • ⏳ Pending)

The quick actions are fully restored to their previously perfect working state. Your comprehensive medical application functionality is back exactly as it was when working correctly.
