# Merge Conflict Resolution Guide

## Current Status
- README.md conflict resolved: Used your current comprehensive documentation
- package.json conflict: Cannot edit due to Replit restrictions

## How to Complete the Merge

### In Replit Git Panel:

1. **README.md**: ✅ Already resolved by keeping your current content
2. **package.json**: ⚠️ Needs manual resolution

### Resolve package.json:
1. Open `package.json` in Replit editor
2. Look for lines with conflict markers:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   (your content)
   =======
   (remote content)
   >>>>>>> commit-hash
   ```
3. **Keep the "dist" version** (line 11):
   ```json
   "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist",
   ```
4. **Remove duplicate lines** and conflict markers
5. **Save the file**

### For @google-cloud/storage conflict:
- Keep: `"@google-cloud/storage": "^7.17.0",`
- Remove the duplicate and conflict markers

### After Resolving Conflicts:
1. Git panel will show "All conflicts resolved"
2. Click "Complete Merge" or "Commit Merge"  
3. Push will happen automatically
4. All 1019+ commits will sync to GitHub

## Result
Once complete, your GitHub repository will have:
- All Vercel deployment configuration
- Professional README.md
- Clean package.json  
- Ready for Vercel import and deployment
