# Vite Build and Server Alignment Issue

## Current Configuration
- **Vite builds to**: `dist/public/` (cannot be changed)
- **Server serves from**: `dist/public/` (correct)
- **Problem**: Server path resolution might be incorrect in production

## Path Resolution Issue
The server uses:
```typescript
const distPath = path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "public");
```

In production, `import.meta.dirname` is `/app/dist/` (Railway container), so:
- Resolved path: `/app/dist/public/` ✅ 
- Vite builds to: `/app/dist/public/` ✅

## Issue Analysis
The configuration is actually correct. The real problem is:
1. Railway is serving cached files from old build
2. Vite builds correctly to `dist/public`  
3. Server serves correctly from `dist/public`
4. Railway cache prevents new files from being served

## Solution
Railway needs to:
1. Clear build cache completely
2. Run fresh `npm run build` 
3. Serve new `index-B9yXiVfA.js` instead of old `index-D_VnzE2d.js`

The Vite and server configuration is already perfectly aligned.
