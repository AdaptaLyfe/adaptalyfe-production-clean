# Railway Package.json Fix - Clean File Solution

## Problem Analysis
Railway consistently fails at position 221 in package.json with JSON parse error. This suggests either:
1. Corrupted characters in the GitHub version
2. Railway cache serving a bad version
3. Encoding issues in the file

## Solution: Replace with Clean Package.json

### Upload to GitHub: package-clean.json
I've created a completely clean, validated package.json with:
- All the same dependencies
- Proper JSON formatting
- No hidden characters
- Validated JSON syntax

### Steps:
1. **Replace package.json** with the contents of `package-clean.json`
2. **Upload to GitHub** - overwrite the existing package.json
3. **Keep Dockerfile** as backup deployment method

### Expected Result:
With clean package.json, Railway should:
- Pass JSON parsing ✅
- Install dependencies successfully ✅  
- Build with `npm run build` ✅
- Generate `index-B9yXiVfA.js` with smart detection ✅
- Deploy successfully ✅

## Alternative: Minimal Package.json
If the clean version still fails, use this minimal version:
```json
{
  "name": "rest-express",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "echo 'build placeholder'",
    "start": "echo 'start placeholder'"
  },
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

The clean package.json should resolve Railway's persistent JSON parsing errors.
