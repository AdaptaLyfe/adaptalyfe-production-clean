# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issues Identified
1. **Wrong package.json reference**: Was pointing to `client/package.json` but your main `package.json` is in root
2. **Wrong dist directory**: Was pointing to `client/dist` but build outputs to root `dist`
3. **Missing build command**: Vercel needs the proper build script

## Fixed vercel.json Configuration
- ✅ Corrected package.json path from `client/package.json` → `package.json`
- ✅ Corrected dist directory from `client/dist` → `dist/public` (matching vite.config.ts)
- ✅ Updated routes to serve from correct `dist/public/index.html`
- ✅ Added client/** to includeFiles for proper build context

## Build Process
Your `package.json` contains:
```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
```

This builds:
- Frontend: `vite build` → `dist/` directory
- Backend: `esbuild server/index.ts` → `dist/index.js`

## Next Steps for Vercel
1. **Push the updated vercel.json** to GitHub (once Git sync resolves)
2. **Redeploy in Vercel** - it will use the corrected configuration
3. **Build should succeed** with proper paths

## Alternative: Manual Deploy
If Git sync continues to have issues:
1. **Download your Replit project** as ZIP
2. **Upload directly to Vercel** via their CLI or web interface
3. **Deploy immediately** without waiting for Git sync

The Vercel configuration is now correct for your project structure!
