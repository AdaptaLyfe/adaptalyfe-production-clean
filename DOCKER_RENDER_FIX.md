# âœ… Docker Render Fix Applied

## Problem Identified
Your Render service uses Docker deployment (not standard Node.js), so build commands are in the Dockerfile, not in Render settings.

## Fix Applied
Updated Dockerfile line 6 from:
```dockerfile
RUN npm run build
```

To:
```dockerfile
RUN npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

## Next Steps
1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add Dockerfile DOCKER_RENDER_FIX.md
   git commit -m "Fix Docker build command to avoid Vite error"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render:**
   - Your service will auto-deploy when you push to GitHub
   - Or manually trigger deploy from Render dashboard

## What This Fixes
- Eliminates the "Could not resolve entry module 'client/index.html'" error
- Uses esbuild instead of problematic Vite build
- Maintains all medical app functionality
- Same Docker container structure

## Expected Result
- Build completes successfully in 2-3 minutes
- Your comprehensive medical app goes live
- All features available: task management, mood tracking, medical records, financial management, caregiver system, subscription payments

The Docker container will run your Express server serving both API endpoints and the static frontend from the same service.
