# Dashboard Content Loading - COMPLETELY RESOLVED

## Issue Resolution Summary
The dashboard login was working but content wasn't loading due to multiple API issues that have now been completely resolved.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Authentication Middleware ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: `requireAuth` middleware was referenced but not properly defined
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive authentication middleware with detailed logging
- **Result**: All protected endpoints now properly authenticate users

### 2. Duplicate Function Declaration ✅ FIXED  
- **Problem**: `requireAuth` was declared twice causing syntax errors
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate declaration, kept enhanced version with debugging
- **Result**: Server starts without errors

### 3. Route Conflict Resolution ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Catch-all route `app.get('*')` was intercepting API calls
- **Solution**: Added API route exclusion logic to prevent interference
- **Result**: API endpoints accessible without conflict

### 4. Session Management Enhancement ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Session cookies not being properly handled for authenticated requests
- **Solution**: Enhanced session configuration and debugging
- **Result**: User sessions persist correctly across API calls

## Verification Tests - ALL PASSING

### Authentication Flow:
```bash
Login: {"success":true,"redirect":"/dashboard","user":{...}}
Session: Sy3jdCIsIjFkyGF9BYtp5-DDlgQsCkn0
Auth Status: ✅ Auth passed - User: demo
```

### API Endpoint Tests:
```bash
GET /api/user: {"user":{"id":1,"username":"demo","email":"demo@adaptalyfe.com","role":"patient","subscriptionTier":"premium"}}

GET /api/tasks: [{"id":1,"title":"Take morning medication","completed":false,"category":"health","userId":1},{"id":2,"title":"Log mood rating","completed":true,"category":"wellness","userId":1}...]

GET /api/medications: [{"id":1,"name":"Vitamin D","dosage":"1000 IU","frequency":"Daily","time":"08:00","userId":1},{"id":2,"name":"Omega-3","dosage":"500mg","frequency":"Daily","time":"08:00","userId":1}]

GET /api/mood-logs: Available
