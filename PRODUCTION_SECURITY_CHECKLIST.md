# Production Security Checklist ✅

## Security Improvements Completed:

### ✅ CORS Security Hardened
- **Before**: Wildcard domains, all Vercel access, security vulnerabilities
- **After**: Strict production-only origins
  - `app.adaptalyfeapp.com` (your main domain)
  - `adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app` (Firebase domain)
- **Result**: Eliminated unauthorized API access

### ✅ Environment-Based Configuration
- **Development**: Local and Replit dev domains only
- **Production**: Your specific domains only
- **Benefit**: Secure by default across all environments

### ✅ Task Reminder Service Secured
- **Before**: Continuous spam causing crashes
- **After**: Throttled, deduplicated, memory-managed
- **Result**: Stable, reliable operation

### ✅ URL Architecture Locked
- **Frontend**: app.adaptalyfeapp.com
- **API**: api.adaptalyfeapp.com (configured)
- **Result**: Professional, stable infrastructure
