# Railway Login Issue RESOLVED ✅

## Root Cause Found
The login was actually working perfectly! The issue was **incorrect credentials**.

## Correct Login Credentials

### Admin Account:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `demo2025` (NOT `admin123`)

### Regular User Account:
- **Username:** `alex` 
- **Password:** `password`

## What Was Fixed

1. **API Routing:** Fixed catch-all routes to exclude `/api/*` paths
2. **CORS Configuration:** Enhanced to handle Railway domains
