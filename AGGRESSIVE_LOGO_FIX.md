# Aggressive Logo Fix Strategy

## Problem:
Logo persistently shows as brain icon despite multiple deployment attempts.

## New Strategy Applied:
1. **Background image approach**: Using CSS background-image with fallback
2. **Cache-busting v=4**: New version parameter
3. **Test page created**: `/logo-test.html` to verify logo loads
4. **Fallback gradient**: If logo fails, shows original gradient background

## Testing Instructions:
1. Visit: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app/logo-test.html
2. Check if your logo appears in the red-bordered box
3. If logo shows on test page but not main app, it's a CSS/caching issue
4. If logo doesn't show on test page, it's a file serving issue

## Alternative Solution:
If logo still doesn't update, we can:
1. Remove the Brain icon import completely
2. Use a text-only logo approach
3. Embed logo as base64 data URL (bypasses all caching)

The logo should now display properly with the background-image approach.
