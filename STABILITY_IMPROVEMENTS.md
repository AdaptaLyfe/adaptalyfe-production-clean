# App Stability & Reliability Improvements

## Current Issues Analysis

### Potential Crash Causes Identified:
1. **Task Reminder Spam**: Overdue reminders firing continuously every few seconds
2. **Memory Management**: Long-running processes without proper cleanup
3. **Database Connection**: Potential connection pooling issues
4. **Error Handling**: Insufficient error boundaries and recovery mechanisms

## Immediate Fixes Implemented

### 1. Task Reminder System Fix
**Problem**: Continuous reminder spam causing performance degradation
**Solution**: Implement proper throttling and deduplication

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem**: Unhandled errors causing crashes
**Solution**: Comprehensive error boundaries and graceful degradation

### 3. Memory Management
**Problem**: Memory leaks in long-running processes
**Solution**: Proper cleanup and resource management

### 4. Database Connection Optimization
**Problem**: Connection exhaustion
**Solution**: Connection pooling and proper cleanup
