# ðŸ”§ ESM Syntax Fix Applied

## Problem Identified
The server was trying to use CommonJS `require()` syntax in an ES module environment (package.json has `"type": "module"`).

## Fix Applied
Updated server-simple.js to use ES module syntax:

```javascript
// Changed from:
const express = require('express');
module.exports = app;

// To:
import express from 'express';
export default app;
```

## This Resolves
- ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope
- Module syntax compatibility with package.json configuration
- Server runtime startup issues

## Push the Fix
```bash
git add server-simple.js ESM_SYNTAX_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix ESM syntax for ES module environment"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
- Server starts successfully without require errors
- Adaptalyfe medical app landing page loads
- Health and API endpoints function properly
- Ready foundation for medical app feature development

The ESM syntax alignment should resolve the runtime module errors completely.
