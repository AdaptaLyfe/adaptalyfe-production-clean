# GitHub Upload Guide - Railway Fix

## Files Ready for Upload
Created `railway-custom-domain-fix.zip` containing all necessary changes to fix the Railway custom domain.

## Upload Steps
1. **Download** the `railway-custom-domain-fix.zip` file
2. **Extract** the contents
3. **Upload** to your GitHub repository (replace existing files)
4. **Commit** with message: "Fix Railway custom domain backend detection"
5. **Push** to trigger Railway deployment

## Key Files Changed
- `client/src/lib/config.ts` - Smart backend detection
- `server/index.ts` - Enhanced CORS configuration
- `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Deployment guide

## What Happens After Upload
1. Railway detects the GitHub push
2. Automatically rebuilds with new code
3. Deploys smart backend detection
4. app.adaptalyfeapp.com starts working properly

## Verification
After Railway deployment completes:
- Visit https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com
- Should load frontend (no blank page)
- Check console: API calls stay on same domain
- Login should work properly

Both domains will work simultaneously:
- Firebase: Cross-origin to Replit backend
- Railway: Same-domain backend calls
