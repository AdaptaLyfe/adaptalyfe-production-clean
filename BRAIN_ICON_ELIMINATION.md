# Brain Icon Complete Elimination ✅

## Problem Fixed:
Brain icons were still appearing in multiple locations within the navigation components, overriding the logo display.

## Actions Taken:
1. **Removed Brain import** from simple-navigation.tsx
2. **Replaced remaining Brain icon** on line 131 with actual logo
3. **Verified logo import** is working correctly
4. **Complete rebuild and redeploy** to ensure changes take effect

## Status:
- ✅ Brain icon import removed
- ✅ All Brain icon references replaced with your logo
- ✅ Logo properly imported via Vite asset system
- ✅ Fresh deployment completed

Your actual AdaptaLyfe logo should now display in both the main header and any menu references, completely replacing all brain icons throughout the navigation system.

Clear browser cache if you still see brain icons (they may be cached).
