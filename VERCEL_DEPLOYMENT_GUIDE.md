# Vercel Deployment Guide - Alternative to Render

Since Render is having persistent caching issues with your app, let's deploy to Vercel instead. Vercel is more reliable for React applications and won't have the caching problems.

## Why Vercel Instead of Render

- **Better React Support**: Optimized for frontend frameworks
- **No Caching Issues**: Fresh builds every time
- **Faster Deployments**: Specialized for static and serverless apps
- **Free Tier**: Perfect for your app

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Step 2: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```

### Step 3: Deploy Your App
From your project directory:
```bash
vercel
```

### Step 4: Configure Build Settings
When prompted:
- **Framework**: React
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

## Vercel Configuration File
Create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist/public"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard, add:
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL` 
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

## Benefits
✅ No Vite dependency issues
✅ Automatic SSL certificates
✅ Global CDN
✅ Easy custom domains
✅ Reliable builds

Your app will deploy successfully on Vercel without any of the caching issues you're experiencing with Render.
