# All Runtime Errors Fixed ✅

## Issues Resolved

Fixed all the errors shown in your screenshots:

### 1. QueryClient Error ✅
- **Problem**: React Query hooks called outside provider context
- **Solution**: Added conditional query enabling and auth page detection
- **Result**: No more QueryClient provider errors

### 2. useRef Null Reference Error ✅
- **Problem**: Missing methods in AuthUtils class
- **Solution**: Added missing `isMobileDevice()` and `ensureSessionPersistence()` methods
- **Result**: Navigation component working properly

### 3. TypeScript Build Errors ✅
- **Problem**: Return type mismatch in ensureSessionPersistence
- **Solution**: Method now returns boolean for proper truthiness testing
- **Result**: Clean build with no errors
