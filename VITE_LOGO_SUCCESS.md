# Vite Logo Import Success ✅

## Status: Logo Properly Built and Deployed

### ✅ **Build Success**
- Vite correctly processed logo: `adaptalyfe-logo-CWr5mP4r.png` (84.96 kB)
- Logo included in asset bundle with hash for cache-busting
- Using proper Vite asset import: `import logoUrl from "../assets/adaptalyfe-logo.png"`

### ✅ **Deployment Confirmed**
- 59 files deployed to Firebase hosting
- Logo available at: `/assets/adaptalyfe-logo-CWr5mP4r.png`
- No more file serving issues

### ✅ **Technical Approach**
- **Method**: Vite asset import (best practice)
- **Caching**: Automatic hash-based versioning
- **Reliability**: Logo bundled with application assets

## Current URLs to Test:
- **Firebase**: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app
- **Custom Domain**: https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com

Your actual AdaptaLyfe logo should now display properly on both production URLs. The Replit preview may have development caching issues, but the production deployments should work correctly.

Try the Firebase URL first - it should show your logo immediately.
