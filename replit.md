## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a modern, responsive design built with React 18 and styled using Tailwind CSS with custom variables for consistent theming. Radix UI primitives ensure accessibility (ARIA compliant) and provide a foundation for reusable components. The design adopts a mobile-first approach with enhancements for desktop, incorporating skeleton loaders for loading states and optimizing touch targets for mobile accessibility. Accessibility is a core focus, including high contrast mode, large text options, and keyboard navigation. The UI includes customizable dashboards, quick actions, and adaptive themes. The application branding features the "Adaptalyfe" logo and "Grow with Guidance. Thrive with Confidence." tagline.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend utilizes React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for server state management, and React Hook Form with Zod for robust form handling. Vite serves as the build tool for optimized development and production builds. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js in TypeScript, offering RESTful API endpoints and centralized error handling. PostgreSQL is used for data persistence, managed by Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations and schema migrations. Real-time updates are achieved through query invalidation. Security is paramount, with HIPAA-compliant audit logging, data encryption, user privacy settings, and access request tracking. Features include a comprehensive notification system, AI chatbot ("AdaptAI"), gamification (achievements, points, streaks), advanced voice commands, and personalized insights.
