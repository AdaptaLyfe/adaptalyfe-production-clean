# Immediate Testing Steps - Railway Integration

## Current Status
✅ Firebase frontend: Working (200 response)
✅ Custom domain frontend: Working (200 response)  
✅ Database environment variables: Added to Railway
⚠️ Backend routing: Still pointing to Replit (needs Railway URL)

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Get Your Railway URL
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your deployment
3. Find the public URL (usually ends with `.railway.app`)
4. Copy this URL

### 2. Update API Configuration
Replace the placeholder in `client/src/lib/config.ts`:
```typescript
baseURL: (typeof window !== 'undefined' && 
         !window.location.hostname.includes('localhost') && 
         !window.location.hostname.includes('127.0.0.1') &&
         !window.location.hostname.includes('replit.dev')) 
  ? 'https://YOUR-ACTUAL-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app' // Replace this
  : '',
```

### 3. Deploy Updated Configuration
1. Push the updated config.ts to GitHub
2. Railway will auto-deploy the change
3. Firebase and custom domain will pick up the new backend URL

### 4. Test Everything Works

#### Quick Browser Test:
1. Open https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Try to log in
4. Check Network tab - API calls should go to Railway URL

#### Expected Flow:
- User visits Firebase: `adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app`
- Frontend loads from Firebase
- API calls route to Railway: `your-app.railway.app/api/*`
- Database queries hit your Neon PostgreSQL
- Response returns to Firebase frontend

### 5. Verification Checklist
- [ ] Login works on Firebase URL
- [ ] Login works on custom domain
- [ ] Tasks, mood, sleep tracking work
- [ ] Payment system functions
- [ ] Same user data appears on all URLs

## Why This Setup is Ideal

**Frontend (Static)**: Firebase/Custom Domain
- Fast global CDN delivery
- Reliable static hosting
- No server load for assets

**Backend (Dynamic)**: Railway  
- Professional Node.js hosting
- Database connectivity
- API processing power
- Payment handling

**Database**: Neon PostgreSQL
- Shared across all deployments
- Consistent data everywhere
- Professional database hosting

This gives you the best of all worlds: fast frontend delivery with robust backend processing.
