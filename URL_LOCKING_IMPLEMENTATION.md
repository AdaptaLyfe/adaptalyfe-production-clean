# URL Locking Implementation Guide

## Goal: Lock API URLs for Maximum Stability

### Current Problem:
- Frontend switching between multiple backend URLs
- Unreliable API connections across different deployments
- Need consistent, professional API endpoint

### Solution: Single Stable API Subdomain

## Step 1: Set Up api.adaptalyfeapp.com Subdomain

### Domain Configuration:
1. **In your domain registrar** (where you bought adaptalyfeapp.com):
   - Go to DNS management
   - Add CNAME record:
     - **Name**: `api`
     - **Value**: `[YOUR-REPLIT-DEPLOYMENT-URL]` (will be provided after deployment)

### Step 2: Deploy to Replit with Custom Domain

1. **Deploy your app** using the Deploy button
2. **Add custom domain** in Replit:
   - Go to your deployment settings
   - Click "Add Custom Domain"
   - Enter: `api.adaptalyfeapp.com`
   - Replit will provide the exact CNAME value to use

## Step 3: Lock Frontend Configuration

### Update API Configuration:
- Set single API base URL
- Remove dynamic URL switching
- Use professional subdomain everywhere

### Environment Variables:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.adaptalyfeapp.com
```

## Benefits of URL Locking:

### Stability:
- Single point of API configuration
- No more URL switching logic
- Consistent backend connection
- Professional subdomain structure

### Reliability:
- Eliminates CORS issues
- Reduces connection failures
- Faster API responses
- Better caching

### Maintainability:
- One place to change API URL
- Simpler deployment process
- Easier troubleshooting
- Professional appearance

## Implementation Steps:
1. Deploy to Replit (get deployment URL)
2. Configure DNS CNAME record
3. Add custom domain in Replit
4. Update frontend configuration
5. Test all API endpoints
6. Verify stability across all features

This creates a production-ready, stable API infrastructure that won't change or fail.
