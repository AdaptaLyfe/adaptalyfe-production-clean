# Stability Fixes Implemented

## Critical Issue Fixed: Task Reminder Spam

### Problem Identified:
The task reminder service was sending continuous overdue reminders every minute, causing:
- System performance degradation
- Log spam with "Overdue reminder sent" messages
- Potential memory leaks from excessive database operations
- User experience issues with notification flooding

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. **Reminder Deduplication**
- Added `sentReminders` Set to track already sent reminders
- Prevents duplicate reminders for the same task/user/date combination
- Uses unique key: `${taskId}-${userId}-${date}`

#### 2. **Throttled Overdue Checks**
- Overdue task checks now limited to **once per hour** instead of every minute
- Prevents continuous spam of the same overdue tasks
- Added `lastOverdueCheck` timestamp tracking

#### 3. **Reduced Check Frequency**
- Changed interval from **1 minute** to **5 minutes**
- Significantly reduces system load and database queries
- Still responsive for time-sensitive reminders

#### 4. **Memory Management**
- Automatic cache clearing every 24 hours
- Prevents memory buildup from reminder tracking
- Scheduled cleanup prevents long-term memory leaks

#### 5. **Startup Stability**
- Added 5-second delay before first check
- Allows system to fully initialize before reminder service starts
- Prevents startup conflicts

## Additional Stability Improvements

### Error Handling Enhancement
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around all reminder operations
- Graceful degradation when database operations fail
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

### Resource Optimization
- Reduced database query frequency by 80% (every 5 minutes vs every minute)
- Eliminated duplicate database operations for same tasks
- Memory-efficient reminder tracking with automatic cleanup

### Production Readiness
- Proper startup sequence with delayed initialization
- Automatic recovery from temporary database connection issues
- Structured logging for monitoring and debugging

## Expected Results

### Performance Improvements:
- **80% reduction** in database queries
- **Elimination** of reminder spam
- **Significant reduction** in system resource usage
- **Improved** application responsiveness

### User Experience:
- No more duplicate overdue notifications
- Timely reminders without spam
- Stable application performance
- Reliable reminder delivery

### System Stability:
- Consistent memory usage
- Predictable resource consumption  
- Reduced log noise
- Better error recovery

The reminder system is now production-ready with proper throttling, deduplication, and resource management.
