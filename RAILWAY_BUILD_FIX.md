# Railway Build Fix - Separate Build Script

## Progress Analysis ✅
Railway auto-detection is working great:
- ✅ File copying successful
- ✅ npm ci installing dependencies  
- ✅ Getting to build stage
- ❌ npm error code EUSAGE on complex build command

## Root Cause
The build script has a complex command:
```
vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

Railway might have issues with this complex command syntax.

## Solution Applied
1. **Created build.sh** - Separate script with explicit npx calls
2. **Minimal nixpacks.toml** - Just start command
3. **Let Railway auto-detect** the build process

### Files to Upload:
- **build.sh** (executable build script)
- **nixpacks.toml** (minimal start only)

## Expected Result
Railway should:
1. Auto-detect Node.js project
2. Run npm ci (already working)
3. Use build.sh for building (cleaner approach)
4. Generate `index-B9yXiVfA.js` with smart backend detection
5. Start with npm start
6. Deploy successfully on app.adaptalyfeapp.com

This separates the complex build logic into a dedicated script that Railway can execute more reliably.
