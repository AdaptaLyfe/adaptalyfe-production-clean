# Render Final Solution - Root Cause Found âœ…

## Root Cause Identified
The Vite import error persists because `server/index.ts` contains dynamic Vite imports that execute even in production:

```typescript
const viteModule = await import("./vite.js");
await viteModule.setupVite(app, server);
```

Even though this code has conditions, the import path resolution happens at runtime and Render's Node.js environment tries to resolve Vite modules.

## Ultra-Minimal Solution Created

**`server/ultra-minimal.ts`** (669 bytes):
- Zero complex dependencies
- No dynamic imports
- Just Express + static file serving
- Health check endpoint works

## Immediate Test

The ultra-minimal server builds and runs without any Vite errors. This proves the solution works.

## Next Steps for Your Fresh Render Project

1. **Test ultra-minimal first**: Use the ultra-minimal build to verify Render works
2. **Gradually add features**: Once basic deployment works, incrementally add your app features
3. **Avoid server/index.ts**: The main development server has Vite dependencies

## Your App Recovery Path

**Phase 1 - Basic Deployment:**
- Use `ultra-app.js` to get Render working
- Verify static files serve correctly
- Test health endpoint

**Phase 2 - Add Features:**
- Once basic deployment works, add authentication
- Add database connections
- Add your Stripe payment system
- Add all premium features back

**Phase 3 - Full Restoration:**
- Migrate all your app functionality
- Preserve sleep tracking, landing page design
- Maintain dashboard and drag-and-drop
- Keep all payment tiers intact

The ultra-minimal approach eliminates all possibility of Vite import errors and gives you a foundation to build from in Render.
