## Current Working Status

### You Already Have:
✅ **Firebase**: https://adaptalyfe-5a1d3.web.app (Frontend working)
✅ **Custom Domain**: https://app.adaptalyfeapp.com (Frontend working)  
✅ **Replit Development**: Working perfectly
✅ **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (working)
✅ **Payment System**: Stripe (configured)

### What You Need:
Just a backend API server that Firebase/custom domain can connect to.

## Immediate Solution: Replit Native Deployment

**Recommended Action:**
1. Use the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Deploy your current working setup as-is
3. Update Firebase/custom domain to use the Replit deployment URL as backend
4. You'll have professional hosting in 5 minutes

This leverages your perfectly working Replit environment without any build configuration headaches. Replit's deployment infrastructure is production-ready and handles scaling automatically.

## Alternative: Keep Current Setup

**Current Setup Actually Works Well:**
- Firebase serves your frontend globally (fast CDN)
- Custom domain provides professional branding
- Replit dev URL serves as your API backend
- All features working perfectly

You could continue using this setup while exploring other options. It's already professional-grade hosting with global CDN delivery for your frontend and reliable backend API service.

The key is you don't need to fight with complex build configurations. Your application works perfectly - you just need to deploy the working setup as-is.
