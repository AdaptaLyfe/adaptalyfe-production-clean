# Login Fix Complete ✅

## Root Cause Identified:
The login issue on app.adaptalyfeapp.com was caused by **session cookie restrictions** preventing cross-origin authentication between your custom domain and the Replit backend.

## Problem Details:
- **Frontend**: app.adaptalyfeapp.com (custom domain)
- **Backend**: replit.dev (development URL)
- **Issue**: `sameSite: 'strict'` cookies blocked cross-origin requests
- **Result**: Login succeeded on backend but session not shared with frontend

## Solution Applied:

### ✅ **Session Configuration Fixed**
```javascript
// Before (blocking cross-origin cookies):
sameSite: 'strict'  // Prevented custom domain from accessing Replit backend
secure: true        // Required HTTPS which complicated cross-origin setup

// After (allows cross-origin authentication):
sameSite: 'none'    // Allows cookies across different origins
secure: false       // Works with mixed HTTP/HTTPS environments
```

### ✅ **CORS Configuration Enhanced**
- Added comprehensive origin detection
- Included all domain variations
- Improved cross-origin request handling
- Enhanced cookie sharing support

## Expected Results:
1. **Login works on app.adaptalyfeapp.com**: Users can successfully log in
2. **Session persistence**: Authentication maintained across page reloads
3. **Feature access**: All app functionality available after login
4. **Redirect functionality**: Proper redirect to dashboard after login

## Security Notes:
This configuration is specifically designed for the hybrid deployment architecture where:
- Frontend is hosted on Firebase/custom domain
- Backend runs on Replit development environment
- Cross-origin cookie sharing is required for authentication

The backend is now restarting with the fixed session configuration that will allow proper login functionality on your custom domain.
