# Vercel Simplified - Static Site Approach

## Issue Identified
Vercel serverless functions are causing runtime version errors. Let's simplify to focus on getting the frontend deployed first.

## Solution: Static Site First
1. Deploy frontend only to Vercel (static site)
2. Keep Railway for backend (or use Firebase backend you mentioned)
3. Frontend will use smart backend detection to connect to Railway API

## Files Updated:
- **vercel.json** - Simplified to static site only
- **Removed api/** directory - No serverless functions for now

## Approach:
1. Vercel builds and serves the frontend (`index-B9yXiVfA.js` with smart backend detection)
2. Frontend automatically detects and connects to Railway backend API
3. If Railway backend is down, falls back to Firebase backend

## Expected Result:
- Vercel: Serves frontend at your-app.vercel.app
- Smart backend detection: Automatically finds working backend
- Authentication: demo_user/password123 works through detected backend

## Next Steps:
Upload simplified vercel.json to GitHub and redeploy. This removes the serverless function complexity and focuses on getting the working frontend deployed.
