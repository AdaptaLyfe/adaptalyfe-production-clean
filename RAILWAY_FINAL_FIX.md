# Railway Login Final Fix Applied

## Root Cause Confirmed
Railway is using `server/index.ts` (not production.ts). The catch-all route in the production section was serving HTML for ALL requests including `/api/login`.

## Fix Applied
Updated both development and production catch-all routes in `server/index.ts`:

```javascript
// OLD: Served HTML for everything
app.get("*", (_req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(distPath, "index.html"));
});

// NEW: Excludes API routes
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  if (req.path.startsWith('/api/')) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: `API endpoint not found: ${req.path}` });
  }
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(distPath, "index.html"));
});
```

## Additional Fixes
1. Enhanced CORS to handle Railway domains dynamically
2. Added detailed API request logging
3. Temporarily allowed all CORS origins for debugging

## Test Now
Your Railway app should now properly handle:
- `/api/login` requests with JSON responses
- Frontend login with admin/admin123
- All app functionality preserved

The login error should be completely resolved now!
